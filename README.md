👋 I’m Dax — transitioning into Linux system administration by building tools, scripts, and real-world systems.

🧠 Background: Previously explored web development (JavaScript, HTML/CSS) but found my stride in Linux infrastructure.

🔧 Now focused on automation, service management, and system reliability.

📁 Pinned below: Projects from my sysadmin learning path.

# System Toolkit

This repo contains a collection of Linux system administration scripts I wrote while training for a junior sysadmin role.

## 🔧 Scripts

All scripts are located in `/bash-scripts`. Key tools include:

- `backup_home.sh`: Backs up home directories to a specific location
- `create_users.sh`: Adds multiple users in bulk with config presets
- `ssh_status_check.sh`: Checks ssh status and if it is secure
- `status-logger.sh`: Checks specified services to see if they are active or inactive

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
chmod +x scripts/backup.sh
./scripts/backup.sh
